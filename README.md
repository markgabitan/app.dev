# My Favorite Movie: *Judge from hell* 
*Judge from hell:* In some religious and mythological traditions, Hell is ruled by a judge-like figure who governs the afterlife, determining the fate of souls. In Christian traditions, this could be seen as Satan or a demon working as a prosecutor in Hell, punishing souls for their sins. In other mythologies, there might be a god or deity associated with the underworld who serves a similar function.
